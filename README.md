## Notes

To be completely honest, for some reason I struggled a lot during this project. Unlike previous assignments that offered clear, step-by-step instructions, this one was completely from scratch. I felt like this was something I should have been able to complete in less than 2 hours, when in fact it took way longer. Looking back made me realize I was definitely overthinking certain aspects of the project.
